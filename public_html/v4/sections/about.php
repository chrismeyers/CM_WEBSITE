                Hey there! My name is <b>Chris Meyers</b> and this page is dedicated to letting you know who I am and 
                the technology skills that I possess.  I studied Computer Science at 
                <a class="fancytxt" href="http://www.rowan.edu/" target="_blank">Rowan University</a>
                in Glassboro, NJ and earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
                Currently, I am employed as a Software Engineer at 
                <a class="fancytxt" href="http://asrcfederal.com/mse" target="_blank">ASRC Federal Mission Solutions</a>.

                During my senior year of High School, I competed in the NJ Technology Student Association (TSA) annual 
                competition.  I placed 3rd in the 'Computer-Aided Design (CAD), 3D, Engineering' category
