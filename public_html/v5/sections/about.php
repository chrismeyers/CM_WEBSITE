                Hello, my name is <b>Chris Meyers</b> and this page is dedicated to letting you know who I am and 
                the technology skills that I possess.  I studied Computer Science at 
                <a class="fancytxt" href="http://www.rowan.edu/" target="_blank">Rowan University</a>
                in Glassboro, NJ and earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
                Currently, I am employed as a Software Engineer at

                Some of my professional interests include: Software Development, Web Development and Computer Networking.
                Over the past few years, I have picked up experience with the following programming languages and technologies:
