        <span>I have spent my entire professional career striving to write clean, modular, and maintainable code. I am always up for the challenge of learning new
        languages and frameworks. If a language or framework that I'm unfamiliar with is the best choice for a project, I have no hesitation in breaking away from
        my comfort zones to explore new options. My primary goal is to create innovative and usable applications that solve problems.</span>
