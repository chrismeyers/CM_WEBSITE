# CM_WEBSITE
This is the codebase for my personal website currently located at <http://chrismeyers.info/>

This website was my first attempt at a web project started back in Fall 2013.  It primarily serves as 
a place to present who I am and the technology skills I possess.  Aside from its informational purpose
(hence the domain extension), it also serves as a sandbox where I can experiment with new technologies.

## Credit
The site uses the [fancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) tool to make viewing images a lot more
pleasant.  Aside from that, everything else has been handmade by myself (and a little help from Google).
