# CM_WEBSITE
This is the codebase for my personal website currently located at <http://chrismeyers.info/>

This website was my first attempt at a web project started back in Fall 2013.  It primarily serves as 
a place to present who I am and the technology skills I possess.  Aside from its informational purpose
(hence the domain extension), it also serves as a sandbox where I can experiment with new technologies.

## Credit
+ The site uses a few open source tools/libraries:
  * [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to simplify animations and DOM traversal/manipulation.
  * [fancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) to make viewing images a lot more pleasant.
  * [hamburgers](https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/) to animate the hamburger menu icon.
